### MyCustomWidget

I have implemented MyCustomWidget.js as a photo slideshow widget, we can add an array of photos either as individual files or URLs.
The intention behind creating this widget goes like this.

- a slideshow of inspirational photos will keep us motivated to reach our goal.
- we may exhaust any number of timers, but to keep a check on our reminder List and complete it, an Inspirational photo will definitely help.

### How to use MyCustomWidget in the planner app

1) open the app hosted @ <a href="https://sg75-planner-app.web.app/" target="_blank">planner-app</a>
2) click on "+ Add Widget" button
3) from the modal window scroll down to the "Inspirational Photos" widget and click it.
